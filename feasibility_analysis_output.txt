RISKS:
  1. risk analysis)deliverablescomplete pcb schematics (pdf and source files).pcb layout files (gerbers, drill files, assembly drawings).bill of materials (bom) with cost estimates for each component.3d model of the pcb (step file) for housing integration.compliance & risk analysis (pre-compliance for certifications like ce, fcc).timelineschematic design – 20 hourspcb layout (2/4 layer depending on demand) – 30 hoursdesign reviews & refinements – 20 hoursfinal deliverables package (gerbers, bom, 3d step, compliance & risk analysis) – 10 hoursnotetotal pcb design time: 80 hourspcb fabrication will be carried out through jlcpcb, ensuring high-quality manufacturing and adherence to design specifications. the estimated lead time for fabrication and delivery is approximately 2-3 weeks.                           total timeline for pcb team: 80 hours
  2. risk.mechanical designthe mechanical design timeline (132 hours) is structured to balance conceptual development, manufacturability, and real-world validation. conceptual sketches & layout (12 hours) are allocated to establish the overall design direction, including placement for the microphone, speaker, charging port, and user interface elements. initial cad modeling (40 hours) is the most time-intensive, as it defines the geometry for the enclosure, cutouts, and internal

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. recommendationfrontend (mobile app): react native with typescript.state management: redux toolkit or zustand (to manage global state like user preferences, chat history, bluetooth connection status).bluetooth: react-native-ble-plxaudio: react-native-track-player (for advanced audio streaming) or react-native-sound.speech-to-text: @react-native-voice/voicebackend (cloud): node.js (express) or python (fastapi) on a cloud provider like aws or google cloud.apis: restful apis or graphql for communication between the app and our backend.
